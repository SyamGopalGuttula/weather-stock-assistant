## 🛠 How It Works

- The `router_agent` uses Gemini to classify intent (weather, stock, news)
- LangGraph routes to the correct agent based on that intent
- Each agent:
  - Extracts keywords or entities with Gemini
  - Calls the correct tool (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, yfinance)
- Output is printed to terminal

## 💡 Future Plans

- 🌐 Add a Streamlit UI
- 📰 Pull real news via RSS or Google News APIs
- 📊 Analyze how weather patterns affect stock prices
- 🧠 Extend LangGraph flow with memory or RAG
